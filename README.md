You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Requirements: 
  - Node.js LTS
  - npm

First install steps:
  1 - After extracting files on a folder, run "npm install" .
  2 - "npm start" to start react app  



Task To-Do(Follow order) : 

        0 - Check your API server status if OK! on the app all buttons seems not working fix that 

        1 - On the register page, there is no way to check if the password is typed correctly or not.
        Think about a solution to prevent mistakes and implement it.
        
        2 - Add a profile page where the user can check its data (Name, Email, ...etc)

        3 - There is a "404" folder (ErrorPage.js) under 404 folder.
            Make sure all others (non-used) paths redirect to that "404" page

        4 - The button "Delete old notes" on the homepage is not working.
            Make sure that all notes that are more than 3 days old are deleted when clicking that button.

        5 - UX/UI :
            The app seems working great! but it is not user-friendly and the styling is terrible.
            Make some improvements on that part, feel free to pick any color/style/icon you want!
        
        6 - Redirect all users who is not sign in to login page
